# CS 1.3 Timo's Cheatsheet
**90 Minute test. Paper. No Computer. Diagrams.**
### Writing high-quality code
* Organization and modularity, separation of concerns
* Refactoring code with helper functions (**DRY principle**)
* Defining new classes and instance methods (**OOP in Python**)
* Encapsulation, composition, and inheritance (**OOP concepts**)

### Python programming
* **Data types** (integer, float, and string)
* **Collections** (list, tuple, and dictionary), common operations
* **String manipulation** (indexing, slicing, splitting, and joining)

### Algorithms
* Algorithm time and space complexity analysis with **big-O notation**
* Recursion, applications to factorial, binary search algorithm, trees, and traversals
* Linear search, binary search (find index of element in array), input assumptions
* String searching (find starting index of pattern in text string), palindrome checking
* Number bases (decoding, encoding, and converting between base 2, 10, and 16)

### Data structures
* **Arrays** (static/fixed-size and dynamic/resizable), operations, automatic resizing
* **Linked lists** (singly-linked only, not doubly-linked), nodes, traversal, operations
* **Hash tables**, operations, hash collision and resolution (chaining with linked lists only, not probing), calculating load factor, automatic resizing and rehashing
* **Binary search trees**, operations, traversals (in-, pre-, post-, and level-order)
* Diagramming how data structures are organized in memory
Performance comparisons between data structures

### Abstract data types (ADTs)
* **List ADT**, stack, queue, operations, implementation with array and linked list
* **Map ADT** (a.k.a. dictionary), operations (contains, get, set, and delete), storing and retrieving key-value entries, implementation with hash table
* **Set ADT**, operations on elements (contains, add, and remove), operations on other sets (intersection, union, difference, and is subset), implementation with dynamic array, sorted array, singly-linked list, hash table, and binary search tree

### Unit testing
* **Reading assertion** failures and stack traces to locate the source of an error
* **Writing assert** statements and unit test functions to ensure correct behavior

# No need to study these:
* Algorithms, data structures, and ADTs **only mentioned briefly or in stretch challenges** (doubly-linked list, deque, circular buffer, hash table collision resolution with probing, self-balancing tree, prefix tree, tree map, multiset, priority queue, heap, graph, etc.)
* **Binary representations of negative numbers** (signed magnitude, ones/twos complement)
* Anagrams, combinations, and permutations
* Python collection iterators and generators
* Reading from and writing to text files
* Word jumble design challenge
* Call routing project
