## Data structures
* **Arrays** (static/fixed-size and dynamic/resizable), operations, automatic resizing
* **Linked lists** (singly-linked only, not doubly-linked), nodes, traversal, operations
* **Hash tables**, operations, hash collision and resolution (chaining with linked lists only, not probing), calculating load factor, automatic resizing and rehashing
* **Binary search trees**, operations, traversals (in-, pre-, post-, and level-order)
* Diagramming how data structures are organized in memory
