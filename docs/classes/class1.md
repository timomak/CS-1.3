# Why do we use base-10?
> Because we have 10 fingers and it makes it easy.

> Our fingers are called digits, it's not just a coincidence.

# What is Binary?
> A base 2 numeral system

* Easy for computers cause they only need to know if it's True or False.
* Only 1 and 0 (True and False)
* Not very readable or usable for humans.

> There's only 10 types of people in the world. Those that get binary and those that don't.

* `#000000` is White
* `#FF0000` is Red
* `#00FF00` is Green
* `#0000FF` is Blue

> Binary and Hexadecimal work very well together.

Four bits of binary can be converted to its Hexadecimal equivalent.
They `tick` at the same values.
